# STAGE 1: Build
# Uses the full .NET SDK image (includes compiler, build tools, etc.)
# This stage compiles the application but won't be in the final image
# ===================================================================
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0 AS build

# Copy only the project file first to leverage Docker layer caching
# If dependencies haven't changed, Docker will reuse this layer
# This significantly speeds up rebuilds when only source code changes
COPY ["Northwind.App.Backend.csproj", "./"]

# Restore NuGet packages based on the project file
# This downloads all dependencies defined in the .csproj file
RUN dotnet restore "Northwind.App.Backend.csproj"

# Now copy the rest of the source code
# This is done after restore to maximize cache efficiency
COPY . .

# Build the application in Release mode
# -c Release: optimized compilation with no debug symbols
# -o /app/build: output directory for build artifacts
# --warnaserror: treat all warnings as errors - build fails if warnings exist

# ===================================================================
# STAGE 2: Publish
# Creates a deployment-ready version of the app
# ===================================================================
FROM build AS publish

# Publish creates a self-contained deployment package
# -c Release: use release configuration
# -o /app/publish: output directory for published files

#   This makes the container smaller and more portable
# --warnaserror: treat all warnings as errors - publish fails if warnings exist

# This is the only stage that ends up in the final Docker image
